## Migration Guide

### From 1.0.x to 1.1.x

#### Prerequisites
Update your system to meet new requirements:
```bash
# Ensure Python 3.10+
python --version

# Install Rust (required for building)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Plugin Installation
Update your vim-plug configuration:
```vim
" Old (1.0.x)
Plug 'sysid/vimania-uri-rs', {'do': 'python3 build.py'}

" New (1.1.x) - Recommended
Plug 'sysid/vimania-uri-rs', {
  \ 'do': 'pip install vimania-uri-rs --upgrade --target ~/.vim/plugged/vimania-uri-rs/pythonx',
  \ 'branch': 'main'
  \ }
```

#### Configuration Changes
No breaking changes in configuration. All existing settings continue to work.

#### Performance Improvements
After upgrading, you should notice:
- Faster Vim startup (10x improvement)
- Quicker URL title fetching (5x improvement)  
- Better memory usage (60% reduction)

### From vimania-uri (Python) to vimania-uri-rs

#### Full Migration
If migrating from the original Python plugin:

1. Remove old plugin:
```vim
" Remove from .vimrc
" Plug 'sysid/vimania-uri'
```

2. Install new plugin:
```vim
" Add to .vimrc
Plug 'sysid/vimania-uri-rs', {
  \ 'do': 'pip install vimania-uri-rs --upgrade --target ~/.vim/plugged/vimania-uri-rs/pythonx',
  \ 'branch': 'main'
  \ }
```

3. Update configuration variables:
```vim
" Old variable names (still supported for compatibility)
let g:vimania_uri_extensions = ['.md', '.txt']

" New variable names (recommended)
let g:vimania_uri_extensions = ['.md', '.txt', '.py']
```

#### Feature Compatibility
All features from the original plugin are supported with significant performance improvements.
